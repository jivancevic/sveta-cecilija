# Feature design notes

Deeper notes on two features whose design is non-obvious. CLAUDE.md keeps a one-line pointer to each.

## Bad-weather venue change, Ljetno → Zimsko (#94)

Admin edit-view action `MarkMovedToZimskoMenuItem`, 2-step:

1. **Preview** — affected-buyer count + sample emails, with **no writes**.
2. **Confirm** — **claims the move atomically before sending mail**:
   ```sql
   UPDATE shows SET venue='zimsko-kino', venue_changed_at=NOW(), venue_changed_by_id=$user
   WHERE id=$show AND venue='ljetno-kino' AND venue_changed_at IS NULL RETURNING id
   ```

Claim-before-send means two concurrent confirmations can't double-notify (the loser claims 0 rows → reported `already-moved`, no send); it also short-circuits `already-moved` / `not-applicable` (a natively-Zimsko show).

The notice is **deduped by email** (`DISTINCT ON (lower(email))` — one per person, not per order) and is **not a refund trigger** (the show still happens). Buyers who want out reply to `info@` and admin refunds case-by-case via the existing flow.

Pure DI orchestration in `src/lib/venue-change.ts`; route `POST/GET /api/shows/[id]/move-to-zimsko`. All buyer-facing venue names come from the shared `VENUE_LABEL` in `src/lib/venues.ts`.

## Marketing-class email + opt-outs (#57)

Only the **post-show review email** is marketing-class. Everything else (ticket confirmation, refund, venue-change) is **transactional** and never checks the opt-out list — it concerns a ticket the buyer already holds.

- **One-click unsubscribe** uses a **stateless HMAC token** (signed with `PAYLOAD_SECRET`, no per-send storage — `src/lib/marketing/unsubscribe-token.ts`) in a footer link, **plus** RFC 8058 `List-Unsubscribe` / `List-Unsubscribe-Post` headers (required by Gmail/Yahoo for bulk senders).
- The opt-out is keyed by **email** in the raw `marketing_optouts` table — by email, not order, so it persists across every future show (each show is a fresh Orders row; a per-order flag would silently re-subscribe on the next purchase).
- `/api/unsubscribe` writes it (`ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, GET = confirmation page, POST = one-click); the dispatch SQL excludes opted-out emails via `NOT EXISTS`.
- A collection-time consent notice (`consent.notice`, EN+HR) sits under the email field on checkout + the `/scan` claim form.
